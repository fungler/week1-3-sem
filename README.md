# 3.-semester
Exercises for 3rd semester

All of the projects in this repository doesn't have any jUnit tests in them, as it did not make sense to create them. We spoke to Thomas who agreed that it was not very practical or useful, so we were allowed to skip them. We are going to learn about integration testing in next week, which is what we actually want to use, to test on out database. unit tests are used to test logic, not database.
I've still tested my methods, but from a main method. It made more sense to test my methods this way, than creating jUnit tests.

tuesdays 'Day-2-JPA-intro' first part is not solved, as it was a very confusing guide and was very basic as well as similar to a project we did right before starting on this exercise.
